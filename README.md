## THIS IS NOT MAINTANED ANYMORE


Credits of Kitsune go to the original maker. I only edited it on parts to make it functional with CPLiteServer.

**NOTICE: THIS KITSUNE IS OLD. USE ![THIS ONE](https://github.com/Zaseth/KITSUNE-MODIFIED "THIS ONE")**


##

Changelog:
* 25-7-2017: (REGISTER - PATCH): UPDATED CSS AND REMOVED BRACKETS IN insertQuery.
* 25-7-2017: (Serverjs) Fixed typo.
* 25-7-2017: (VERY IMPORTANT - REGISTER): KNOWN ISSUES FULLY FIXED. ANTI-VULNERABILITY SCANNER ADDED TO REGISTER.
* 24-7-2017: (IMPORTANT - REGISTER): SECURITY UPDATE ADDED.
* 24-7-2017: Redirect.html added for use (in /public/ folder)
* 24-7-2017: You can run PHPMYADMIN if you set Apache's port to something else than 80 or 3001. Set Apache's SSL also on to a different port like 7443 and Apache itself like 780
* 24-7-2017: (Serverjs, contact.handlebars & views): updated css paths so that /contact/ wont give broken css + contactdata comes with date&time and csrf is now a const. VueJS (Javascript Framework that I added in the /public/ html pages) will now also auto grab the latest version. (VueJS is used here for faster loading)
* 23-7-2017: (Serverjs): Contactdata is stored in a better way.
* Readme will be updated daily for fixes.

# Introduction
CPLiteServer is a webserver that only runs on javascript. It comes with a fully working website, register and a contact/feedback page.
The server itself runs on NodeJS with Express. The reason I created this is to replace Apache completely and you can now work in an open-source, fast and easy environment. I hope you enjoy the usage!

VueJS has been added into the website theme. Enjoy the speed!

##
# Required programs
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Get the *latest* version)
* [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) for running MySQL (You can check everything in the setup)
* [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) for database management
* Kitsune (Already included, but old version)
* The modified database (Already included)
##
# Setup
* Install NodeJS

You first want to install NodeJS. Once you did that, type the following in CMD: *node -v* (If you receive the version, NodeJS is set up right! Else, restart your PC)

* Install XAMPP

With XAMPP, we will be running MySQL as CPLiteServer and Kitsune will access MySQL.

**NOTE: YOU NEED TO ADD A PASSWORD TO MYSQL**

* Install MySQL Workbench

We use MySQL Workbench to manage our database. We will not be using PHPMYADMIN in this case. (You can though)


* Installing your modules

Alright, now you need to download CPLiteServer and extract the files into: *\xampp\htdocs* like so:

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/12ccdf324d1076c1283b9108535ca4cc.png "CPLiteServer")

When you did this, open CMD and enter the command: *cd yourpath* as example: *cd E:\xampp\htdocs* 

Now, you enter the following command: *npm install*

This will install every required module that CPLiteServer needs to run. If you receive an error like: *Missing module modulename* then just enter the following command: *npm install modulename* as example: *npm install jade*

Next up, you need to set up the register. The register runs on a different *port*. CD to the /CPLiteServer-Register/ folder and type in the following command: *npm install*

Again, if you get any missing modules, you know what to do :)

##

# Configuration
This part is **VERY** important, so please follow.

### Server file configuration

In the javascript file *server*, you can edit the following lines to your needs:

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/95231fe471368c69f38b3826e59c0582.png "CPLiteServer")

This is the php.exe path.

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/2f7aac045b2fe488d8d0d9bb9c13ab1f.png "CPLiteServer")

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/24156b76fe7abb40f140b772892ad911.png "CPLiteServer")

This piece of code will close the connection if a certain user is sending a lot of requests (Only closes connection between that user)

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/190afa83e1d357c50671b13160424fa1.png "CPLiteServer")

This will assign the web address of the server.

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/7eb201e3635fa7793bad58b68310ffa5.png "CPLiteServer")

This will auto create a correct crossdomain.xml with the *WWW* you filled in. Regex over here is the string that it finds.

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/1a72b7f326a3c9a7d413de0b542dfafc.png "CPLiteServer")

This is the code to block a specific file. If you have a custom mediaserver, edit the paths. **THE PATHS WILL BE CORRECT IF YOU DOWNLOAD CPLITESERVER WITH THE MEDIASERVER INCLUDED**


![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/56da4149489fb3de8b21affd13981667.png "CPLiteServer")

This is the status page. You can access this on: *localhost/status* or: *yourfilledinWWW/status*


![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/60d355a383158046f859ce1d6e900d1f.png "CPLiteServer")

This is where the *page visit count* runs. This runs on socket.io. This will run on: *localhost:3001* or: *yourfilledinWWW:3001*
A custom 404 not found has been added to this. You can access it by adding */socket.io/* to the url. **NO CRITICAL DATA IS FOUND HERE**

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/bbce44ea076107888681bd65d1d0eb87.png "CPLiteServer")

Here, Express will render index.html when the url gets visited.

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/a9424cf71fed68f119640ad13266f6b3.png "CPLiteServer")

Here, Express will use all the resources located at the folder /public

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/7392d58346822602e504fcf17054597b.png "CPLiteServer")

This piece of code manages the contact/feedback page. You *should* modify csrfkey. The contact data is all logged and stored in: */logs/contactdata/contactdata.txt*

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/e693c71c007fdcd41e506e0e0ede9604.png "CPLiteServer")

If there is a 404 not found, it will render a custom 404 page.

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/87ccc43337b58aafdaa9468e1433c429.png "CPLiteServer")

Normally, Express will give a header saying that the app is using Express. CPLiteServer will disable this specific function.

All the logs are stored in: */logs/*

**NOTE: EDIT SOCKET.IO AND HTML STUFF IN: /PUBLIC/PLAY/INDEX.HTML + INDEX.HTML**
**NOTE: EDIT THE NAVIGATION BAR IN THE /PUBLIC/ HTML FILES AS REGISTER IS LOCATED ON localhost:5000/signup**

**NOTE: THE FOLDER IN PUBLIC/REGISTER/ IS NOT BEING USED**

### MySQL configuration

In the javascript file *mysql_conf*, you should edit the following lines to your needs:

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/00b78ceed1c7eb7103c8dd4c1297959b.png "CPLiteServer")


**NOTE: YOU SHOULD SET THE SAME CONFIGURATION IN THE FOLLOWING FILE: /KITSUNE/DATABASE.XML**
##


### Register configuration


![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/33274ca0035ca98aec2d253203f77598.png "CPLiteServer")

The register is running on a different server. You can access the register on: *localhost:5000/signup*. You need to import the included *kitsune* database.


Now, I will explain you what the javascript file: *server* does:


![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/e5a5ab52a2ad7614c3ac99fe0a83c4d8.png "CPLiteServer")

### MySQL configuration for register

The configuration file is located in: *CPLiteServer-Register\app\config\config.json*

Now, something *very* important again, *\CPLiteServer-Register\app\config\passport\passport.js* is the root file for the register. **IN HERE ALSO IS A MYSQL CONFIGURATION THAT YOU NEED TO SET** (and yey first Club Penguin with a javascript register)

You should also check out the passportjs file for configuration (You can set a new penguin's inventory! How cool is that?)

Important code on passportjs file:

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/acc3f99567eadce55b69ea15eab63249.png "CPLiteServer")

MySQL configuration in passportjs for register

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/b555b1f696dccb79053adb7ce5dea183.png "CPLiteServer")

Tells MySQL to use the database *kitsune*

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/f96983520b0ad997289c45a21f9a3cde.png "CPLiteServer")

Various configuration when a penguin registers (What the penguin gets automatically)

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/37bc6119611539e6146804b86d15710a.png "CPLiteServer")

If username contains any of these characters, disallow them! Most important blacklisted characters in here are: *<* & *>* these 2 chracters are used in javascript. Without them, you won't have XSS :)

**NOTE: THERE IS A SIGNIN, BUT IT IS HIDDEN. IF YOU TURN THIS BACK ON, HAVE FUN FEELING PAIN ON MAKING IT WORK. WE ONLY NEED A REGISTER. THE USER SIGNS IN ON THE GAME ITSELF**


### Database changes

While creating CPLiteServer, I modified some stuff to the database from Kitsune. This database is included in the following folders: */Kitsune/* and */CPLiteServer-Register/* **THEY ARE EXACTLY THE SAME.**

##

### Extra

CPLiteServer comes with various extra modules to play around with. You can find these in: */modules/*

An example of a module:

*generatecrossdomain:*

```javascript
var fs = require('fs');
var xd1 = '"';
var xd2 = '"';
var domain1 = '*.localhost.com';
var domain2 = 'www.localhost.com';
var xmlVersion = '<?xml version="1.0"?>';
var versionWrite = '<!-- This crossdomain.xml is generated using CPLiteServer and created by Zaseth -->';
var breakLine = "\r\n";
var headXml = '<site-control permitted-cross-domain-policies="master-only"/>';
var siteUrl = '<allow-access-from domain=' + xd1 + domain1 + xd2 + " " + 'secure="false"/>';
var siteUrl2 = '<allow-access-from domain=' + xd1 + domain2 + xd2 + " " + 'secure="false"/>';
var siteHeader = '<allow-http-request-headers-from domain=' + xd1 + domain1 + xd2 + " " + 'headers="SOAPAction" secure="false"/>';
var siteHeader2 = '<allow-http-request-headers-from domain=' + xd1 + domain2 + xd2 + " " + 'headers="SOAPAction" secure="false"/>';
var xmlEnd = '</cross-domain-policy>';
var stream = fs.createWriteStream("crossdomain.xml");
console.log('Done');
console.log('Created by Zaseth');
stream.once('open', function(fd) {
  stream.write(xmlVersion);
  stream.write(breakLine);
  stream.write(versionWrite);
  stream.write(breakLine);
  stream.write(headXml);
  stream.write(breakLine);
  stream.write(siteUrl);
  stream.write(breakLine);
  stream.write(siteUrl2);
  stream.write(breakLine);
  stream.write(siteHeader);
  stream.write(breakLine);
  stream.write(siteHeader2);
  stream.write(breakLine);
  stream.write(xmlEnd);
  stream.end();
});
```


Some information to announce about each file and folder:
* Server

This is the root of CPLiteServer. Here, our webserver starts the connection. Please take a look at this file to configure it.

* mysql_conf

This is your MySQL configuration file. In here, you need to set the configuration to your needs. **(WITH A STRONG PASSWORD)**

* contact & thankyou

CPLiteServer comes with a fully working contact/feedback page. The other files are in the *views* folder.

* index.html

This is the main file.

* package.json

This file is where you install every module *(These modules get placed into the folder node_modules*

* Public folder

In this folder there will be every resource that the *users* can access. **SO DO NOT STORE IMPORTANT STUFF IN HERE**

**NOTE: NODEJS CAN ONLY RUN JAVASCRIPT. SO NOT PHP. THE MEDIASERVER THAT IS INCLUDED (WHICH YOU CAN DOWNLOAD ON A DIFFERENT LINK IN THIS DOC) CONTAINS PHP FILES, BUT ARE UNACCESSABLE BY A METHOD THAT CPLITESERVER USES.**

##

### Starting the servers

To start CPLiteServer, cd to the folder and enter the command in CMD: *node server.js* and it should start.

To start the register, cd to the register folder and enter the command in CMD: *node server.js*.
